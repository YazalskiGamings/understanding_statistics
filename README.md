# Introduction

Here, I will upload any projects that are related to statistics. The repo will include, not limited to, Bayesian analysis, simulation studies, time series forecasting, Statistical Techniques, and anything that interests me regarding statistics.

## 1) Interpretation 95% Confidence Interval (Bayesian vs Frequentist)
  - Small excerise that differentiates between bayesian and freqentist interpretation.

## 2) Asymptotic vs Exact Behavior in Small and Large Samples for a Method (ANOVA vs Kruskal Wallis Method of Test Comparison)
  - Nonparametric vs parametric behavior under different conditions (normal/non normal + small/large sample) and compare the methods.
